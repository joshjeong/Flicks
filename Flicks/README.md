## Notes
- Spent quite some time trying to get the scroll view right. I think I got it by manipulating the constraint depending on the height of the label. Would love to know if there's a better solution.
- When I'm programmatically creating a tab view controller in my AppDelegate, I'm not entirely sure if I'm correctly displaying my views. Do I present my navigation controllers then push the corresponding view?
- Am I filtering movies properly? It seemed hacky to put an if statement every where stating if it was to use the filtered list or original movies list.
